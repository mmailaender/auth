## 🧩 What is Auth UI?

**Auth** gives you full-ownership authentication and organization management for **SvelteKit** or **React** — built on  
**Better Auth + Convex**, wrapped in an extensible UI layer you completely control.

You don’t integrate a service.  
You **copy the components into your repo** — shadcn-style — and customize everything.

- 🔐 **Own your code** – no lock-in, every line lives in your repo
- ☁️ **Self-hosted** – powered by your Convex backend
- 🎨 **Design system included** – theme it to match your brand
- 🪄 **Polished UX** – dialogs, transitions, and responsive layouts out of the box

---

## 🚀 Why Auth UI?

Adding auth is easy.  
**Owning it** — design, data, and cost — isn’t.

Auth gives you hosted-provider convenience **without losing control**:

- **You own the code.**  
  No opaque SDKs or black-box UIs — everything is editable and local.

- **Your user data stays with you.**  
  No mirroring, no duplication — all stored in your Convex database.

- **You control the costs.**  
  No per-user or per-org pricing. Scale freely on your own infrastructure.
